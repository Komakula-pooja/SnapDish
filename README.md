## ‚ú® Features

SnapDish is a full-stack application designed to showcase a modern, animation-rich frontend and a powerful AI backend.

* **AI-Powered Recipe Generation:** Leverages the Google Gemini 2.0 flash model to analyze ingredients from an image and generate a complete recipe, including title, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions.
* **Multimodal Input:** Accepts both an image of ingredients and optional text-based dietary preferences (e.g., "vegetarian," "gluten-free").
* **Stunning Animated Landing Page:** A fully responsive, single-page design built with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create an engaging user experience.
    * **Interactive Hero Section:** A dynamic grid of images that subtly react to the user's mouse movement.
    * **Immersive Scroll Section:** A horizontal "storytelling" section powered by ScrollTrigger that reveals the app's process.
    * **Dynamic "Benefits" Showcase:** A pinned, full-screen section where features morph into one another on scroll.
* **Polished User Interface:** The entire application, from the homepage to the playground, is built with a consistent dark theme, "glassmorphism" effects, and glowing accents for a premium feel.
* **Interactive Playground:** A clean, two-column interface where users can upload an image, add preferences, and receive their custom recipe in a beautifully formatted, scrollable card.
